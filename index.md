## SWHID Working Group
The SWHID Working Group oversees development of the SWHID materials in the [SWHID GitHub repositories](https://github.com/swhid), including the following:

* the SWHID specification itself
* the various software libraries and tools provided by the SWHID project

### Working version of the specification document

A link is provided to the [working version of the SWHID specification](specification), that is updated automatically whenever a change is made to the [SWHID Specification repository](https://github.com/swhid/specification).

### Participation and governance

Participation in the elaboration of the SWHID standard is open to all, 
Design and planning is primarily done via the team [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/swhid-discuss) and meetings: see the dedicated [SWHID Specification repository](https://github.com/swhid/specification) for more information.

The SWHID specification is maintained by the [SWHID core team](coreteam).

The working group follows the principles stated in [the governance document](https://swhid.org/governance/) maintained in the [governance repository](https://github.com/swhid/governance/).
